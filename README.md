# CEMIRA-CogArch
Repository for CEMIRA Cognitive Architecture

This Cognitive Architecture is developed for the purpose of my PhD Research which is about integrating non-verbal human feedback in a robot's cognitive architecture so that the robot will be able to detect and react properly to error situations and adapt to human preferences during a human-robot collaboration scenario.
